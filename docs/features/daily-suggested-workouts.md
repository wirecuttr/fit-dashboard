# Daily Suggested Workouts Investigation

## Summary

Garmin Daily Suggested Workout activities import as regular activities today, but
their FIT files contain extra planned-workout metadata. That metadata can support
a workout-aware interval table instead of showing only generic laps.

This document records current findings from sample files.

The investigation focused on:

- `20122336922_ACTIVITY.fit` - cycling sprint workout
- `22730347417_ACTIVITY.fit` - running base workout
- `23122091367_ACTIVITY.fit` - running sprint workout
- matching Garmin Connect GPX and TCX exports for the same activities

## Current App Behaviour

On the `daily_workouts` branch, the current parser imports these FIT files as
normal activities. Regular telemetry, session summaries, and lap summaries are
available.

The current parser does not preserve the Daily Suggested Workout structure:

- `Workout.wkt_name`
- `Workout.num_valid_steps`
- `WorkoutStep` definitions
- `Lap.wkt_step_index`
- lap `intensity`

As a result, FIT Dashboard cannot currently show Garmin-style `Intervals`
tables for these activities.

## File Format Findings

### FIT

FIT is the useful source for workout structure.

The samples contain a `Workout` message:

```text
Workout.wkt_name
Workout.num_valid_steps
Workout.sport
```

Example:

```json
{
  "wkt_name": "Sprint",
  "num_valid_steps": 5,
  "sport": "running"
}
```

The samples also contain `WorkoutStep` messages. Fields observed include:

```text
WorkoutStep.message_index
WorkoutStep.wkt_step_name
WorkoutStep.duration_type
WorkoutStep.duration_value
WorkoutStep.target_type
WorkoutStep.target_value
WorkoutStep.custom_target_value_low
WorkoutStep.custom_target_value_high
WorkoutStep.intensity
```

Examples of planned-workout step names found in raw FIT strings:

```text
2x15x0:10@360W
5x0:10@3:25/km
```

The first means two sets of fifteen 10-second sprint efforts at 360 W.

FIT lap messages link recorded laps back to planned workout steps with:

```text
Lap.wkt_step_index
```

Lap messages also include ordinary lap fields such as:

```text
lap_trigger
total_timer_time
total_elapsed_time
total_distance
avg_heart_rate
avg_power
normalized_power
```

`lap_trigger` is not unique to Daily Suggested Workouts. It is also present on
regular activities. It tells why a lap ended, such as `distance`, `time`, or
`session_end`.

### GPX

GPX preserves the activity-level workout name in the track name:

```xml
<name>Calgary - Sprint</name>
<type>running</type>
```

or:

```xml
<name>Calgary - Base</name>
<type>running</type>
```

GPX does not preserve the interval/workout-step structure.

### TCX

The TCX exports appear to preserve normal lap and trackpoint data, but not the
Daily Suggested Workout structure. A quick text scan did not find workout names,
step names, or interval labels comparable to the FIT workout metadata.

## Unique Daily Suggested Workout Fields

Compared with a regular cycling FIT sample, `23060547104_ACTIVITY.fit`, the Daily Suggested Workout-specific fields are:

```text
workout
workout.num_valid_steps
workout.sport
workout.wkt_name

workout_step
workout_step.message_index
workout_step.wkt_step_name
workout_step.duration_type
workout_step.duration_value
workout_step.target_type
workout_step.target_value
workout_step.custom_target_value_low
workout_step.custom_target_value_high
workout_step.intensity

laps[].wkt_step_index
```

Fields such as `lap_trigger`, lap time, lap distance, lap power, lap heart rate,
and lap calories are useful for display but are not unique to Daily Suggested
Workouts.

## Reconstructing Garmin-Style Interval Tables

Garmin Connect labels the table as `Intervals`, not `Laps`, for these workouts.
The displayed rows are partly recorded laps and partly derived workout-step
summary rows.

The table can be reconstructed from:

- `Workout.wkt_name`
- `WorkoutStep.message_index`
- `WorkoutStep.wkt_step_name`
- `WorkoutStep.duration_type`
- `WorkoutStep.duration_value`
- `WorkoutStep.target_type`
- `WorkoutStep.custom_target_value_low/high`
- `WorkoutStep.intensity`
- `Lap.wkt_step_index`
- lap `intensity`
- lap `lap_trigger`
- lap order
- lap `total_timer_time`
- lap `total_distance`

For first implementation, showing recorded lap rows with workout-derived labels
is likely enough. Garmin-style group rows, such as `Warm Up 1 - 3`, can be added
after the raw step/lap mapping is preserved.

## Interval Table Reconstruction Process

The reconstructed table below was produced from decoded FIT lap fields plus the
workout metadata found in the same file.

Process used:

1. Read the `Workout` message to identify the workout name, sport, and planned
   step count.
2. Read all `WorkoutStep` messages. Each step is keyed by
   `WorkoutStep.message_index`.
3. Read all `Lap` messages in chronological order.
4. For each lap, read:
   - `wkt_step_index`
   - `intensity`
   - `lap_trigger`
   - `total_timer_time`
   - `total_distance`
5. Match each lap to its planned step using:

   ```text
   Lap.wkt_step_index == WorkoutStep.message_index
   ```

6. Derive the displayed row type:
   - `warmup` -> `Warm Up`
   - `interval` -> sport-specific work label such as `Run` or `Bike`
   - `rest` -> `Recovery`
   - `cooldown` -> `Cool Down`
7. Number repeated work/recovery pairs by chronological occurrence. For the
   running sprint sample, each `interval` lap followed by a `rest` lap becomes
   interval `1`, `2`, `3`, etc.
8. Calculate cumulative time by summing lap `total_timer_time` values in order.
9. Convert distance from metres to kilometres for display.
10. Add derived group rows by grouping contiguous laps that share the same
    high-level section, such as warmup or cooldown. The group row has no lap
    number and uses the summed time, final cumulative time, and summed distance.

Notes:

- A final `session_end` lap may have an `intensity` but no `wkt_step_index`.
  For the sample below, it is grouped with cooldown because it has
  `intensity=cooldown` and immediately follows the planned cooldown step.
- Garmin Connect may use additional internal logic for exact grouping. The goal
  here is to preserve enough fields that FIT Dashboard can reproduce a close,
  deterministic interval table.

## Reconstructed Running Sprint Table

Source file:

```text
23122091367_ACTIVITY.fit
```

Workout:

```json
{
  "wkt_name": "Sprint",
  "num_valid_steps": 5,
  "sport": "running"
}
```

Workout step string found in FIT:

```text
5x0:10@3:25/km
```

Lap data used:

| Lap | wkt_step_index | Intensity | Trigger | Time | Distance km |
|---:|---:|---|---|---:|---:|
| 1 | 0 | warmup | distance | 5:53.7 | 1.00 |
| 2 | 0 | warmup | distance | 6:10.0 | 1.00 |
| 3 | 0 | warmup | time | 2:56.3 | 0.46 |
| 4 | 1 | interval | time | 0:10 | 0.05 |
| 5 | 2 | rest | time | 3:00 | 0.26 |
| 6 | 1 | interval | time | 0:10 | 0.06 |
| 7 | 2 | rest | time | 3:00 | 0.27 |
| 8 | 1 | interval | time | 0:10 | 0.06 |
| 9 | 2 | rest | time | 3:00 | 0.27 |
| 10 | 1 | interval | time | 0:10 | 0.06 |
| 11 | 2 | rest | time | 3:00 | 0.25 |
| 12 | 1 | interval | time | 0:10 | 0.05 |
| 13 | 4 | cooldown | distance | 6:27.9 | 1.00 |
| 14 | 4 | cooldown | time | 3:32.1 | 0.54 |
| 15 | none | cooldown | session_end | 0:02.2 | 0.01 |

Reconstructed table:

| Interval | Step Type | Lap | Time | Cumulative Time | Distance km |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Warm Up | 1 - 3 |  | 15:00 | 15:00 | 2.46 |
| Warm Up | 1 | 1 | 5:53.7 | 5:53.7 | 1.00 |
| Warm Up | 2 | 2 | 6:10.0 | 12:03.7 | 1.00 |
| Warm Up | 3 | 3 | 2:56.3 | 15:00 | 0.46 |
| 1 | Run | 4 | 0:10 | 15:10 | 0.05 |
| 1 | Recovery | 5 | 3:00 | 18:10 | 0.26 |
| 2 | Run | 6 | 0:10 | 18:20 | 0.06 |
| 2 | Recovery | 7 | 3:00 | 21:20 | 0.27 |
| 3 | Run | 8 | 0:10 | 21:30 | 0.06 |
| 3 | Recovery | 9 | 3:00 | 24:30 | 0.27 |
| 4 | Run | 10 | 0:10 | 24:40 | 0.06 |
| 4 | Recovery | 11 | 3:00 | 27:40 | 0.25 |
| 5 | Run | 12 | 0:10 | 27:50 | 0.05 |
| Cool Down | 13 - 15 |  | 10:02.2 | 37:52.2 | 1.55 |
| Cool Down | 13 | 13 | 6:27.9 | 34:17.9 | 1.00 |
| Cool Down | 14 | 14 | 3:32.1 | 37:50 | 0.54 |
| Cool Down | 15 | 15 | 0:02.2 | 37:52.2 | 0.01 |

The final 2.2-second `session_end` lap has `intensity=cooldown` but no
`wkt_step_index`. The planned cooldown step itself is 10:00 across laps 13 and 14. Garmins add lap 15 as Cool Down as well.

## Activity Naming Considerations

Garmin Connect appears to separate activity title, sport icon, and sport/subsport
subtext.

Observed regular road-cycling activity display:

```text
Title: Calgary Road Cycling
Icon: cycling
Subtext: Road Cycling
```

Observed Daily Suggested Workout road-cycling display:

```text
Title: Calgary - Sprint
Icon: cycling
Subtext: Road Cycling
```

This suggests Garmin uses `Workout.wkt_name` as a display-title suffix when a
planned workout exists, while preserving canonical sport/subsport separately.
The underlying activity is still road cycling; the workout name changes the
activity title, not the sport classification.

A Connect-like title rule would be:

```text
if location and Workout.wkt_name exist:
    title = "{location} - {Workout.wkt_name}"
else:
    title = existing normal activity-name logic
```

FIT Dashboard consideration: the current app does not have a separate sport icon
or sport/subsport sublabel in the activity list equivalent to Garmin Connect's
layout. It primarily has one `activity_name` field. If the name becomes
`Calgary - Sprint`, the sport context may be less visible unless the UI also
shows sport/subsport elsewhere. That should be considered before changing import
naming behaviour.

## Execution Score

Garmin Connect shows an execution score for Daily Suggested Workouts. I did not
find an explicit decoded field named execution score, adherence score,
compliance score, or similar in the known fields exposed by the JavaScript FIT
parser used for investigation.

Related fields observed:

```text
session.workout_feel
session.workout_rpe
session.total_training_effect
session.total_anaerobic_training_effect
session.training_load_peak
session.primary_benefit
activity_metrics[].aerobic_training_effect
activity_metrics[].anaerobic_training_effect
activity_metrics[].primary_benefit
```

These are not the same as workout execution score.

Possible explanations:

- Garmin Connect calculates execution score server-side from planned target
  ranges and recorded telemetry.
- The score is stored in a FIT field that the current parser does not decode by
  name.
- The score is available through Garmin Connect APIs but not included in
  activity FIT exports.

For implementation, treat execution score as unresolved. Preserve enough planned
step target data and recorded lap/record data that a future implementation could
calculate a local approximation if Garmin's exact value is not available.

Known sample values:

- `23122091367_ACTIVITY.fit` shows `98%` execution score in Garmin Connect.
- `22730347417_ACTIVITY.fit` shows `84%` execution score in Garmin Connect.
- These values have not yet been found as named decoded FIT fields.

## Open Questions

- Can Rust `fitparser` expose all `WorkoutStep` messages with names and target
  ranges? The JavaScript parser used in investigation collapsed repeated
  `WorkoutStep` messages into a single `workout_step` object.
- Are Garmin Connect execution scores present in standard FIT fields that
  require additional enum decoding, or are they only available through Garmin
  Connect outside the exported FIT?
- Should first implementation show only recorded intervals, or also derived
  Garmin-style group rows?
- Should workout names influence `activity_name` on import, or should FIT
  Dashboard first add a separate sport/subsport indicator so sport context is
  not lost when titles become location-plus-workout-name?
